- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hardcode3
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in digital sciences, more importantly in the engineering and geology domains, working on applied maths.
- ðŸŒ± I currently code in Python using many scientific packages and C++ as my secondary language for the moment.
- Like to develop organized and clean pieces of software, sometimes juste for fun (see my Chess repo using pygame !)
